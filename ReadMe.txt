Subtitle Fetcher by Cherry. (cherrynamburu@gamil.com) (instagram : @imurscherry)

It is a python script which automatically downloads subtitles for the videos present in the current directory.

Copy the file 'subtitle_fetcher' only(without the ReadMe file) to directory in which movies are present
and double click(Run) the python file(script).

Subtitles for the movies or series will be atomatically downloaded.

If script wont work install python 3(wont work in python2) in your system and install required modules and try again.

If script returns file not found, the following may be the cases:
	- No internet connection(very slow)
	- Subtitles for the video is not present in the website used by script(in this case try downloading manually)
	
	
This script only works in windows os only. (not for mac/linux)
